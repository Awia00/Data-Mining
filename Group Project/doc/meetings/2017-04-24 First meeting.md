# First meeting with Sebastian
* It might be easier to follow the path of neuroevolution rather than deep-learning.
* It has less math, and we don't need to design the architecture to be entirely differential.
* Look at the 3rd paper Sebastian sent. (It has reference implementations in Java and SharpNEAT)
	* It would be interesting to add the temporal links from the first article (but very ambitious)

## Steps
* Get the evolutionary to work as is.
* See how it works on our problem without temporal links
* Then add temporal links, and compare to the results from before.
