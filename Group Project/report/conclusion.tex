\section{Conclusion}
We were unsuccessful in training an evolutionary neural turing machine to be able to find the shortest path in a undirected unweighted graph. Only a fitness value of $\approx0.35 $ was achieved which outperforms the a strategy which randomly picks moves. The network was not able to fully learn how to recognize edges in the graph but indicated higher values for the correct move than the average case. 
The difference between the neural turing machines and the regular neural networks was insignificant and in average the networks without memory achieved a higher fitness. 

\newpar There is a lot of possible extensions and areas left unexplored which could provide more interesting results. Allowing the network to multiple times read and write to memory in one activation or changing the structure of experiments might allow the networks to better plan ahead.
