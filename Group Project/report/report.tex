\section{Background}
\subsection{Graphs}
A \textit{graph} $G(V,E)$ is data-structure which consists of a set of \textit{vertices} $V$ and a set of \textit{edges} $E$ where an edge is a pair of vertices $(u,v)$. An \textit{undirected graph} implies that if edge $ (u,v) $ exists then $ (v,u) $ exists in the graph. An \textit{unweighted graph} every edge is equal in the cost to traverse it. 
Two vertices are \textit{adjacent} if they are part of the same edge $ e $. A \textit{path} $ P $ is a ordered set of edges such that every consecutive edge shares a vertex. To vertices $ u $, $ v $ are \textit{connected} if there exist a path between $ u $, $ v $.

In an undirected unweighted graph the length of a path P is $ |P| $. A shortest path between two vertices  $ u $, $ v $ is a path $ P $ connecting  $ u $, $ v $ of the smallest length. The Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm can find the shortest path in time $ \mathcal{O}(n+m) $ where $ n=|V| $ and $ m=|E| $. To be able to solve this combinatorial problem for which the exhaustive search space is $ n! $ the BFS algorithm uses a queue to store previously visited vertices and a map of the vertices and which vertex would come before it in the shortest path.

\subsection{Neural Networks}
A \textit{neural network} is an approximation method for n dimensional functions. Neural networks consists of a collection of \textit{layers} $ L_1 .. L_n $ where $ L_1 $ is the \textit{input layer} and $ L_2 ... L_{n-1} $ are \textit{hidden layers} and $ L_n $ is the \textit{output layer}. Each layer $ Li $ consist of a number of \textit{neurons}. A neuron is connected to other neurons in the layer before and after its own layer. Neurons can send signals to other neurons it is connected to. The strength of a signal is specified by a \textit{signal function} of a neuron. Neurons gets \textit{activated} and sends a signal if itself has become activated a \textit{threshold} amount by other neurons. The signal function is based on a \textit{formula}, a \textit{weight} and a \textit{bias}. 

The \textit{feed forward algorithm} activates the neurons of the input layer based on some input data, whom in return activates the neurons of the next layer and so on. The values of the output layer is then read. The \textit{backpropagation algorithm} calculates the error of the output neurons compared to the input data and corrects it based on a function. The errors or then backpropagated through the layers. By running the feed forward and backpropagation algorithms in combination with enough data, almost any function can be approximated.

A \textit{one hot encoding} of a nominal data point, is a conversion of the data point into a bit array $ A $ with the length of the range of possible nominal values. For a nominal value $ i $ only $ A[i] $ is $ 1 $.

\section{Experiment}
Given an unweighted undirected graph $G$, a source vertex $s$, and a target vertex $t$, find the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ in $G$.

We have restricted the problem to instances where a path between $s$ and $t$ exists.

\subsection{Instance encoding}
In order to feed the instance into the network, we use a one hot encoding of the adjacency matrix of the graph and each of the source and target vertices. See \autoref{fig:input:encoding} for an example.

\end{figure}

\noindent When the neural network using the turing machine returns output, this is a one-hot encoding of the next vertex on the path to the target. Furthermore, for simplicity we choose the first node with maximal weight.

\newpar This means that we can run the graph through the neural network multiple times, and each time, the neural network will tell us which vertex to move to, which we can give it back as the new source vertex to move from.

\subsection{Instance generation}
Each experiment has a few settings that can be chosen between.
A number of these settings are related to instance generation.

We have made a factory that produces graphs containing a path of a specified length, but with the rest of the vertices connected to this path, in some fashion.

The configurations that can be chosen between for this factory is the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The number of vertices of the graph
	\item The length of the path that should be found in the graph
	\item The seed of the random number generator that is used to produce instances
	\item Whether or not the same graph should be used in symmetric instances, that is, one instance with a source and goal and another where they have been switched.
\end{itemize}

The factory then chooses a source and a goal, and builds a path of the specified length between them.
If there are any unused vertices left in the graph, they will become adjacent to some other vertex in the connected component of the path.
The last part is implemented to try to confuse the neural networks, since the input is given to them as an adjacency matrix.

\subsection{Fitness}
We have chosen to give the following scores for the output of each step on the shortest path:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[1] if there is an edge from the current vertex to the chosen vertex, but the distance from the chosen vertex to the goal vertex is greater than from the current vertex to the goal vertex.
	\item[2] if there is an edge from the current vertex to the chosen vertex, but the distance from the chosen vertex to the goal vertex is the same as from the current vertex to the goal vertex.
	\item[4] if there is an edge from the current vertex to the chosen vertex, but the distance from the chosen vertex to the goal vertex is less than from the current vertex to the goal vertex.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, we give the score 0, if one step resulted in a move where no edge exists. Also the accumulated score is reset to 0, and no further steps are performed.

The gist of these scores is that we want to reward neural networks that understand the underlying graph problem (or can at least guess them) more than a network that chooses arbitrarily.

\subsection{The Experiments}
To assess and measure how well the shortest path problem is solved, two times three experiments are performed. The first three experiments uses the NEAT framework to train and build the neural networks. The last three experiments uses the ENTM extension of the NEAT framework and can therefore in addition approximate Neural Turing machines. The memory is unlimited (within the bounds of the host machine), the write vector size is 4 and the default jump mechanism introduced in \todo{ref ENTM} is used. 

Both networks uses the exact same configuration for NEAT and the general problem to make it easier to compare the two. Each configuration uses 30 species with population of 500. Each genome is tested on 25 unique graphs per generation. The entire configuration can be seen in appendix \todo{appendix}. 

\section{Results}
The results of the experiments can be seen on figure \ref{experiments:graph:1}. The $ y $ axis shows the fitness of the champion whereas the $ x $ axis shows the generation. The experiments shown with blue represents the configuration without memory and those shown in red with memory.
